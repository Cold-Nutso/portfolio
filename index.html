                            <p>I initially made this with Windows Forms. In that version, you can cycle each word among a family of similar or related words. Below I've placed a couple screenshots of what the program looks like.</p>

                            <p>The most useful thing about the downloadable version is having complete vocabulary control. I created an editor that lets you pretty easily add, alter, or remove words and word families. If you wanted, you could use that to create an entirely new set of non-edgy vocabulary.</p>

                        <p>This is a really small JavaScript game I programmed. I'd describe it as an arcade-style beat-em-up. You punch the crowned skeleton and watch it ricochet across the screen. The crown falls onto another skeleton ghost and the process repeats. If a crowned skeleton touches you, that's game over. So try and punch as many as possible to get a high score before that happens.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>That crown movement was real difficult to accomplish so you better appreciate it. It took a decent amount of physics brain to make that all happen. But the result is totally worth it, it's a great organic visual indicator of which skeleton ghost will wear the crown next.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>Despite adamantly hating typography, one day I felt like making a font. It's a cool enough project, but if you don't set limits you could be working on the same font for eternity.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Now this <em>is</em> a pixel font, which I know is a little lame. There are so many out there and they all look identical. Apart from the lowercase letters and some small punctuation, I did try to give the font a unique feel. They have sort of a rune-ish look to them.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I used <a href = "https://fontstruct.com/">Fonstruct</a> to make this. I'd recommend it to anyone looking a simple font. If for some reason you'd like to use my font in a project, feel completely free! I'd love to know about it too.</p>

                    <div class = info>
                        <p>I created a mod character for <a href = https://store.steampowered.com/app/585710/Blazing_Beaks>Blazing Beaks</a> (developed by <strong>Applava</strong>). The game is a roguelike bullet-hell that capitalizes on the inherent risk/reward of being greedy. It's ridiculously charming and I can't recommend it enough.</p>
                        <br>
                        <span class = centered>Now let's talk about the <em>Champion of Worms</em>!</span><br>
                        <img class = centered id = worms1 src = "media/projects/champion_of_worms/profile.png" alt = "Champion of Worms profile sprite.">
                        <br>
                        <p>It's me. The design is just an exaggerated me. Fortunately, I'm pretty cool, so the prompt makes for a stellar character. The common theme between all <em>Blazing Beaks</em> playable characters is that they have beaks (or bills). I thought I could justify ignoring that rule with lore. He's there to represent every worm so cruelly consumed by avian forces. "Champion of Worms" is an actual title I hold as well, so it all checks out.</p>
                        <br>
                        <img id = worms2 src = "media/projects/champion_of_worms/jump.gif" alt = "Champion of Worms jump sprite.">
                        <p>I also changed the character's stats to better represent me. He has a really fast rate of fire, an absolutely miniscule amount of health, and a tendency to find extra artifacts. It reflects the way I play; constantly firing, gathering absolutely every item I see, and just assuming I'm not going to get hit.</p>
                        <br>
                        <img id = worms3 src = "media/projects/champion_of_worms/walk.gif" alt = "Champion of Worms walk sprite.">
                        <p>I don't have a lot of patience for animating so I'm thankful <em>Blazing Beaks</em> went as bare bones as they could with their style. And in addition to a bunch of sprites, I recorded some audio to go along with it. They definitely aren't the pinnacle of voice acting, but it's fun to hear myself in a game.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Mega cheers to <strong>Applava</strong> for making the mod creation process both simple and intuitive. Without their forward thinking I probably wouldn't have done this.</p>

                        <p>Here's a JavaScript project that utilizes the <a href = "https://pokeapi.co/">Pokémon API</a>. It's a fantastic source of information for every Pokémon in the dex. Literally any information you want about a specific Pokémon can be found here. Super cool.</p>
                        <p>To find your Pokémon doppelganger, just input your height and weight. The results will come pouring in. If you're having some trouble finding a match, you can edit the leniency of the measurements and find Pokémon that are <em>close enough</em>.</p>
                        <p>Realistically, there are only going to be a select number of Pokémon any of us will find. Most of them aren't even humanoid, so their height to weight ratios won't be very human either. But practically isn't the point. It's a fun and stupid thing you'll use exactly once.</p>

                    <p>Logos, icons, and pictographs make up a significant portion of my digital art. I like my work to be simple and representational. Shapes matter most, so ideally the piece should work even if monochromatic. I usually try to find the minimum amount of detail I can use to represent an object or idea.</p>

                    <p>Sometimes I make art that's a little more visually complex than your average symbol. It's pretty much always characters. Characters are fun to design and draw. I'm still reasonably new to digital drawing so I'm frequently changing styles and Photoshop brushes.</p>

                    <p>This is the first medium I started working to improve in and it is very dear to my heart. Pixel art is a more limited format than pencil drawing, so your choices have a lot of weight to them. You can also make a crochet project out of any of these pretty easily.</p>

                    <p>The majority of the art I do is drawn in a spiral notebook. Blank paper is too intimidating, so all my physical drawing has to be done on lined paper. Problem is, that doesn't scan very well so I've been trying to do more sketches on the computer.</p>
