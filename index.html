                    <h3 class = left>Small Art</h3>

                    <p>Logos, icons, and pictographs make up a significant portion of my digital art. I like my work minimal and symbolic. Shapes matter most, so ideally the piece should work even if monochromatic. I try to find the simplest form I can to represent an idea.</p>

                    <h3 class = right>Big Art</h3>

                    <p>Sometimes I make art that's a little more visually complex than your average symbol. It's usually a character, because they're the most fun. I'm still reasonably new to digital drawing so I'm frequently changing styles and Photoshop brushes.</p>

                    <h3 class = left>Pixel Art</h3>

                    <p>This is the first medium I started working to improve in and it is very dear to my heart. Pixel art is a more limited format than pencil drawing, so your choices have a lot of weight to them. You can also make a crochet project out of any of these pretty easily.</p>

                    <h3 class = right>Digital Sketches</h3>
                    
                    <p>The majority of the art I do is drawn in a spiral notebook. Blank paper is too intimidating, so all my physical drawing has to be done on lined paper. Problem is, that doesn't scan very well so I've been trying to do more sketches on the computer.</p>
